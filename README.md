Working Paper Insee - Balance sheet policies and Central Bank losses in a HANK model

To reproduce the Working Paper: 

- use MATLAB for Steps 1 to 3
- use Stata for Step 4

Step 1: run Graphs_data.m = plots Figures 1 and 9 from main text

Step 2: run MAIN_3_policies.m = run the model (Steady States and Transitions)

Step 3: (MUST RUN Step 2 BEFORE!!) run Graphs_results.m = plots all other Figures in the main text

Step 4: Run Stata3.do in Stata
